      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html">Somalia</a>, officially the Federal Republic of Somalia is a sovereign country in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west,the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Indian Ocean to the east, and Kenya to the southwest.</p>

      <p>Somalia is a country of geographic extremes. The climate is mainly dry and hot, with landscapes of thornbush savanna and semidesert, and the inhabitants of Somalia have developed equally demanding economic survival strategies.</p>

      <p>Apart from a mountainous coastal zone in the north and several pronounced river valleys,most of the country is extremely flat, with few natural barriers to restrict the mobility of the nomads and their livestock.</p>

      <p>The Somali people are clan-based Muslims, and about three-fifths follow a mobile way of life, pursuing nomadic pastoralism or agropastoralism.</p>

      <p>The Republic of Somalia was formed in <time datetime="1960">1960</time> by the federation of a former Italian colony and a British protectorate.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siad_Barre">Mohamed Siad Barre</a> held dictatorial rule over the country from October 1969 until January 1991, when he was overthrown in a bloody civil war waged by clan-based guerrillas.</p>
